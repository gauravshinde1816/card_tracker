### âœ“ Details:

Internally, letâ€™s say we identify a user with their phone number, and for this particular task, let us ignore the country code, and set it to be a 9 digit number. A userâ€™s card has a unique identifier as well, and for this task, we can assume that all entities involved uses the same ID to refer to the card.

Hereâ€™s a top level flow of what happens to a card

- Card is generated by us
- Card is picked up by courier partner
- Card is delivered
- If the Card could not be delivered, re-delivery is attempted maximum of two times
- If all attempts of delivery fail, it is returned to us
